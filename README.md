README file that explains how 'run_analysis.R' works.

There is one script 'run_analysis.R' that loads the data as dataframes, and manipulates the data as described in the CodeBook. You have to make sure that you
have downloaded and unzipped the original zip-file in your working directory for R. 
The script generates two data sets:
- One data set, combined from both the training and test data, that contains all mean and std features for all subjects and activities.
- A reduced data set, that contains the mean of all mean and std features for each subject and acitivity.
